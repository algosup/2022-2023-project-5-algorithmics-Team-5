## Krug Champagne Winery Software - Blending Stage

This project involves building software for Krug Champagne's winery to assist in the blending stage of champagne production. The software aims to achieve the closest result to the given formula while minimizing the number of steps required. The key steps in champagne production include harvesting, pressing, first fermentation, blending, second fermentation, aging, riddling, disgorgement, and dosage.

### Objective
The software's focus is on the blending stage (Stage 4), where the Cellar Master and her team create the perfect formula for Krug Grande Cuv√©e by blending 250 wines of the year with 150 "reserve" wines from the past 14 years. The goal is to produce the closest result to the formula with minimal steps.

### Resources
The software has access to 330 tanks of various sizes that can be reused, along with a system of pumps and pipes to connect any tank with another. It is crucial to avoid leaving tanks partially full or empty to prevent oxidation.

### Evaluation Criteria
The software will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Correctness**: The software should run without crashes and ensure no tanks are left partially full or empty.
2. **Formula Accuracy**: The final blend should closely match the given formula.
3. **Code Quality**: The code should be well-documented, with clear comments and adhere to idiomatic style.
4. **Minimum Steps**: The software should achieve the desired result with the fewest number of steps possible.
5. **Speed**: The code should be optimized for efficient execution.
