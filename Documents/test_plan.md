# Test Plan

## 1. Test Approach

For this project, the program will be tested using a combination of unit testing and system testing. Unit testing will be used to test the individual components of the program, and system testing will be used to test the program as a whole.


## 2. Test Items

The program will have to be tested as a whole as well as in parts (e.g. the different functions).

## 3. Features to be Tested

The following features will be tested:

- The program can be run.
- The program can be run with different arguments.

## 4. Approach

When a new function is added to the program, it will be tested using unit testing. 
When a new feature is added to the program, it will be tested using system testing by the QA.
When a bug is found in the program, it will be tested using system testing by the QA.


## 5. Item Pass/Fail Criteria

When a test is launched, if the test pass, the test will be marked as passed and updated as working at the date of the test. 
If the test fails, the test will be marked as failed, a report of the bug will be made by the QA to the developer and added to the bug report document, then be tested again at a later date.
If the test fails only from time to time, the test will be marked as failed, a report of the bug will be made by the QA to the developer and added to the bug report document, then be tested again at a later date.

## 6. Test Deliverables

Only after all the tests have been passed, and all the features added, the program will be considered as finished and ready to be delivered.
components of the program, and system testing will be used to test the program as a whole.
