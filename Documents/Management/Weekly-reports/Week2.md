# Week Report - Week 2

## Introduction
This week, our team made significant progress in the development of the project. We focused on the initial stages of documentation, including the technical specification, test plan, and test cases. Additionally, we started writing the code in C++. We encountered some challenges in finding an appropriate algorithm for the code. Furthermore, we had a productive meeting with the other team to discuss collaboration and coordination.

## Progress Summary
- Initiated the development phase by beginning work on the technical specification document.
- Commenced drafting the test plan, outlining the testing approach and methodologies.
- Started preparing test cases to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- Began coding in C++, laying the foundation for the implementation phase.
- Conducted a meeting with the other team to foster communication and alignment.
## Challenges and Risks
- Encountered difficulties in finding a suitable algorithm for the code implementation. Further analysis and exploration are required to overcome this obstacle effectively.

## Upcoming Tasks
Moving forward, we will address the challenges faced in identifying the appropriate algorithm for the code. Our plan for the upcoming week includes:

- Conducting further research and analysis to identify potential algorithms.
- Collaborating with the team to brainstorm and discuss alternative approaches.
- Continuation of the documentation process, refining the technical specification, test plan, and test cases.
- Continuing the implementation phase in C++, focusing on modular and scalable code architecture.
- Scheduling regular meetings with the other team to ensure seamless collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Conclusion
Despite the challenge encountered in finding an algorithm, the team made substantial progress in the project's early stages. The initiation of documentation and code development sets a strong foundation for future work. We remain committed to resolving the algorithm challenge and will continue to work diligently towards the project's success.
