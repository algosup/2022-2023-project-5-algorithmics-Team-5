# Project Charter: Krug Champagne Winery Software Development

## Project Name: Krug Champagne Winery Software Development
## Project Number: 2023-2024 Project 5

## 1. Project Overview:
The Krug Champagne Winery Software Development project aims to create a software solution to assist the Cellar Master and her team at Krug Champagne, a subsidiary of LVMH, in the process of blending champagne. The software will facilitate the identification and formulation of the perfect formula for Krug Grande Cuvée, using a combination of current-year wines and reserve wines from the past 14 years.

## 2. Project Objectives:
- Develop a user-friendly software application that streamlines and enhances the blending process of Krug Grande Cuvée.
- Enable the Cellar Master and her team to taste and experiment with different combinations of wines efficiently.
- Provide functionality to calculate and adjust the proportions of wines in the blending process based on the desired formula.
- Ensure seamless integration with existing infrastructure, including 330 tanks of various sizes and the pump and pipe system.

## 3. Project Scope:
- Focus solely on Stage 4: Blending, where different wines are combined to create a consistent flavor profile for Krug Grande Cuvée.
- Design and develop a software application that allows the Cellar Master and her team to record and track the combinations of wines, along with associated tasting notes and results.
- Implement algorithms and tools to aid in the calculation and adjustment of wine proportions based on the desired formula.
- Integrate the software with the existing infrastructure of tanks, pumps, and pipes to enable seamless transfer of wines during the blending process.

## 4. Stakeholders:
- Project Sponsor: Krug Champagne (LVMH)
- Project Manager: Lucas AUBARD
- Krug Champagne Winery Team
- IT Development Team
- Quality Assurance Team
- End Users: Cellar Master, Assistant Winemakers

## 5. Deliverables:
- Fully functional and user-friendly software application for blending champagne, including a database to store and manage wine combinations, tasting notes, and results.
- Integration of the software with existing infrastructure, allowing for the seamless transfer of wines between tanks.
- Comprehensive documentation, including user manuals and technical specifications.

## 6. Project Timeline:
The project will span from 5/02/2023 to 6/23/2023, with the following major milestones:
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- Software design and development
- Integration with existing infrastructure
- User acceptance testing

## 7. Project Risks:
- Technical challenges in integrating the software with the existing infrastructure.
- Potential delays in acquiring accurate taste and blending data for testing and development.
- Limited availability of resources, including the Cellar Master's time for testing and providing feedback.
- Data security and confidentiality risks associated with handling sensitive information about the blending process.

## 8. Project Resources:
- IT Development Team
- Cellar Master and his team
- Existing infrastructure: 330 tanks, pumps, and pipes

## 9. Project Governance:
- Project Manager: Lucas AUBARD
- Regular project status meetings to report progress, discuss issues, and make decisions.
- Decision-making authority lies with the Project Manager, in consultation with the Project Sponsor and key stakeholders.
- Communication channels: Regular updates via Slack, project management software, and face-to-face meetings.
